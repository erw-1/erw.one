# Personal website

I do geomatics (GIS) and cartography. Don't expect my code to be flawless, it's mainly a hobby because coding is fun and useful :D 

Uses and plans for the future : 
--
- Homepage
  - Personal portolio (GIS stuff, maps, etc, ...)
  - A page for my CV
  - Maybe I'll add a photography section since I like to take pictures
  
- hosting random web projects in the "apps" folder
- URL shortener with redirects in the "r" folder
- more random stuff
