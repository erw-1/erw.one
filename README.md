# Personal do-it-all website


I do geomatics (GIS) and cartography. Don't expect my code to be flawless, it's mainly a hobby because coding is fun :D 

Plans for the future : 
--
- Personal portolio (GIS stuff, maps, etc, ...) (Homepage)
- a page for my CV
- Maybe I'll add a photography section since I like to take pictures
- hosting random web projects (voirie, cacp)
- URL shortener with redirects (wc)
- random stuff
